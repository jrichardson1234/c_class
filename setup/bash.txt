bash - Linux Bourne Shell, known as "Bourne Again Shell" since the first
version was "sh".

Uses emacs key strokes for history and in line editing. *** BIG FEATURE ***

Runs shell scripts of commands.

End with .sh to know its a shell script, though you don't have to.

To make it run as a command, do the following:

chmod a+x script.sh

This changes the mode of the file to executable for everyone.
