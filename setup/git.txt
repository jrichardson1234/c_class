GIT is a source code version control system.

Remembers your previous changes. Lets you get back or compare (diff)
them if you make a mistake and break something.

Also useful to merge changes from others, and to send your changes (diffs)
to others.

Works with github.com, which is a cloud based online repository for gits
called repo's for repositories.

Note: There can be other git repositories, including ones you setup
your self on your own local computer, server, or cloud account. Companies
such as Microsoft now do this for internal software, and use github.com
when communicating with Microsoft enabled open source software.
