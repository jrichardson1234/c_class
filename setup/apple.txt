Apple has their own ghetto, ignore it for now. If forced to do a native
iPhone app, try and use a tool kit to cross compile from Android, or
Microsoft Xamarin (C# based).

Truth is, today 90% of "phone apps" can be done as progressive web apps,
or Cordova/PhoneGap using standard languages and technologies.

Apple environment:

Their own obsolete language called Objective-C, bought from a failed company
years ago by Nextstep.

Swift - Apples new C# like language to try and stay current, rather than
adopting Java, C#, or the new Google Go. Good thing they are under 10%
market share again as they have been historically. Don't hang your professional
career on their ecosystem. I warned you.

Also this OS is not Linux, or really a full Unix. They are a version of
BSD (an OK Unix before Linux) on top of a Mach kernel which Nextstep
grabbed from open source. (actually a pretty good kernel).

But *EVERYTHING* is apple layout, not using any existing standards. It's
a mess, you can't download and build standard Linux open source stuff
without special apple ports, tools, development environments, etc.

They are rumored to be developing their own CPU for the Macs. Hopefully
they do this soon to speed up their decline when they realize they
hold a party and no one shows up.

Trying to "fix it" with a virtual machine just leads to crashes and
poor performance with devices you plug into your Mac. So pat your Mac
on the head as the pretty thing it is, but don't invest to deeply in it.

Computer History NextStep == Apple today. NextStep reverse acquired Apple
when they Apple board agreed to take Steve Jobs back. Yes, it was one
of the greatest business moves obviously. Sadly he is gone now, and Apple
is wandering in the wilderness with its care taker managment. Never good
for a tech company. But then again, they are phone fashion business more
than technology today. Yeah, another industry famous for losing its way
when a visionary founder is gone.
