Note that the K&R C book shows "cc" or C Compiler.

There is one on Linux, but its best to use "gcc" or the newer
Gnu C (and C++) compiler. This has the correct symbol information
for debugging, and more modern features such as support for other
languages.

The Linux kernel and device drivers are built with gcc.
