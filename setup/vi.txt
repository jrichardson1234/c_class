vi - Visual Text Editor

Note: emacs is preferred for serious programming. But vi is installed
by default on almost all Linux/Unix machines, so its handy to know
the basics in order to configure some system config file before
installing emacs. For example edit the wifi file so you can download
emacs :-)

Most important vi command "sudo apt-get install emacs24" :-)

vi file.c

ESC - escape key. Pretty much if in doubt in vi, hit this key.

vi is modal, meaning its in navigation mode to move around the screen
or file or in edit mode inserting or overwriting text.

The ESC key gets you out of edit mode and into navigational mode.

vi file.c

Once you in the file do:

ESC - for good measure, you never know what mode its in.

Navigating:

Note: The modern PC's arrow keys are easier, but you need to know
these basics since you might be on a legacy VT100/ansi remote terminal
connection and need to use the standard keys.

h - move one character to the left

l - move one character to the right

k - move up a line

j - move down a line


i - insert text, goes into insert mode at cursor so you can type.
    ESC to get out (of course)

a - append text at the end of the current line.

ESC-:-w - save file. ESC to leave edit mode, ':' for command, w for write.

ESC-:-q - quit so you can go back to emacs :-)

ESC-:-q! - quit but don't save file, since vi messed it up on you.

After all this slow modal stuff, are you now ready to go back
to emacs?

Note: I wrote these notes in emacs, vi is that bad!
