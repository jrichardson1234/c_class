SVN, GNU RCS, etc. - These are obsolete source control systems replaced by GIT.

Some projects still cling on to them from the older days. Thankfully many
people now maintain github.com "relections" or relatively up to date copies
so you can use modern tools and forget about these systems.

Note: linux kernel.org still sticks to this in some cases for some unknown
reason, even though Linus Torvolds himself invented git.
