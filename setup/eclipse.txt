Eclipse - Linux GUI environment for programming.

The Linux world answer to Microsoft Visual Studio.

Open source, originally developed by IBM for Java, then open sourced
and used to implement other languages including C/C++.

Don't start with this, stick to the basics. C, emacs, gdb, bash, git, make.

Once you have advanced, the benefit of Eclipse/VisualStudio is when you are
developing more GUI or large object oriented projects in Java, C++, or C#.

For these projects it introduces class browsers, template generators, and
a more "visual" (read easier) debugger style for people who don't
understand or want to focus on the machine, but the higher level logic
problems at hand. It has its place.

Eclipses main popularity recently is as the visual development environment
for Android applications.
