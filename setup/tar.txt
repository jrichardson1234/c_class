tar is a popular file archiver for Linux. Operates similar to .zip

tar -tvf - list files in a tar archive

tar -xvf - extract files form the tar archive into the local system.
           be careful with this, use tar -tvf to see where the files will
           go, otherwise could overwrite your own system files!

tar -cvf archive.tar file1 file2, file3 ...
        Create a new tar achive named archive.tar from the listed files.
